    "#### Goal:\n",
    "Your goal is to predict whether a mortgage application was accepted (meaning the loan was originated) or denied according to the given dataset, which is adapted from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Metric:\n",
    "We're predicting a binary variable, so this is a classification problem. To measure classification, we'll use a metric known as accuracy (also known as \"classification rate\"). Accuracy is one metric for evaluating classification models. Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions our model got right. For binary classification, accuracy can be calculated in terms of positives and negatives as follows:"
